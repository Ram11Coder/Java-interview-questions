What is public static void main(String[] arg){}?

Whether the class main method or not ,properly declared or not these checking are not responsible of compiler.
JVM will check at runtime.

if not properly declared then throws NosuchmethodError:main

public -> it is used to call by jvm from anywhere.
static -> Without creating object jvm has to call the method
void  -> It does not any value to jvm
main -> name of the method which is configured inside JVM

String[] arg -> Command line arguments
we can customize the behaviour of main method

Example:(Valid main method)
--------
public class Main {
	final synchronized public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Main method");
	}
}
