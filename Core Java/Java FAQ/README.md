### 1.How to access static member in java application?

Accessing static members[Variable,Methods]

1. From static context
- Class name(Yes)
- this(No)
- ObjectReference(Yes)

2. From Non-static context

- Class name(Yes)
- this(Yes)
- ObjectReference(Yes)


### 2.Why we can't use this inside static context?

this - Predefined non-static variable
Every java program have static and non-static context?

1.Static - Free accessible area
Example: Reception
2.Non-static - Restriced access, need to take permission
Ex: class room
permission - ID card required

Objects
room1 - Java 
room2 - Android
room3 - SpringBoot

Scenerios:
Me : where is java class room?

Receptionist can not say this is a class room
Because Receptionist inside the reception so impossible to use this keyword

Then how receptionist address particular class room?
For every object one user defined identity is very important is called user-defined object reference variable

Receptionist can reply room1.java (Room1 java class is going on)
room1 , room2, room3 -> Userdefined obj reference
Using user-defined obj ref to access non-static variable/methods

### 3.Limitation of default constructors?
Compiler provide noarg constructor only if no constructor args provided in java souce code
Compiler does not provide noarg constructor if parameter constructor args are provided in java souce code

### 4. Diff between POJO and Bean?
POJO rules:
- Class is public
- Properties are private
- Default constructor
- Public setter and getter methods

Bean 
- All POjo rules are applied 
- Additionally Bean object can be serialized [Bean must implement java.io.serializable interface]
