Top 10 Algorithms
1.Math concept->Lograthimic concept
2.Graph traversal(DFS,BFS)
3.Binary search
4.Sliding window technique(2 pointers)-> subarray
5.Recursion (Teaches us logic adn implementing it is easily)
6.Inversing binary tree and reversing linkedlist(Can solve many sub problem in LL)
7.Suffix tree(Adv DS)-> String problems
8.Heaps(Repeated find smallest or largest elements)
9.Dynamic programming (Helps to solve complex problems)
10.Sorting algorithms (Quick sort and merge sort)
