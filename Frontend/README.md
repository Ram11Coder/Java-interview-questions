### Frontend learning process
1.Foundation
- First thing first. To become a front-end developer, you need to start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- These are actually the fundamental languages for front-end development. 
- HTML is used to structure our web pages, CSS to make them beautiful, and JavaScript to program them.

2. Front End Frameworks
- building websites often include a bunch of repetitive tasks. And that’s where front-end frameworks and libraries come.
- To be more accurate, React is not a framework but a library. The main difference between a framework and a library is that a framework forces our application into a structure. So all the applications build-up using a framework like Angular, end up having a similar structure. So as you move from one project to another, you will find a similar structure. On the other hand, Libraries don’t force our application into a structure. They just provide some code to reuse.
- Out of all these, React is the most popular. It’s built by Facebook and used to build Facebook and Instagram. So I would say go for React as a starting point.

3.Version Control Systems
We use version control systems to track our code history and work more collaboratively with others

4. CSS Preprocessors
- CSS is kind of an old language and it has its own limitations. If you write CSS for medium or large-size applications, sooner or later, your code starts looking messy and it becomes really hard to manage. So every time you want to change something, you end up breaking something else.
- Now you will wonder why CSS hasn’t evolved. Well, it has and currently, it is at version 3. But every time there is a new feature in CSS, all the browsers need to support that feature. Which is, unfortunately, is a slow process. So this is where CSS Preprocessor comes in.
- A CSS preprocessor is a program or tool that lets you generate CSS from a different language that is better and more capable than CSS. So instead of using plain CSS, we use another language that looks pretty similar to CSS.
- we give our code to a CSS preprocessor that converts it into plain CSS which every browser understands. That’s the purpose of CSS preprocessors.
- There are many CSS preprocessors available like SASS, LESS, and Stylus to name a few. SASS is the most popular among them.

5. Superset of JavaScript
- Just like CSS, JavaScript is also a fairly old language. Although it’s getting updated from time to time, it still does have some limitations. 
- So, a lot of front-end developers prefer more modern languages like TypeScript and CoffeeScript to write code. 
- Then they give their code to a program called Transpiler which will translate and compile the modern code into old JavaScript code that all browsers can understand.
