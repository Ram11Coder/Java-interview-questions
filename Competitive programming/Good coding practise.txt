1.Good coding practise
----------------------
Consideration:

correctness
***********
-> We want to make our program testable(Create a class then put your main logic)
-> Use junit to create the test cases
-> take a look at your check any over flow possibility(Any type of data type over flow)

efficiency
**********
-> whether our algorithm is fast enough
{
if there are 10^8 then can be done in 1 sec
10^7-> 0(n)
10^6->O(n* logn)
10^4->O(n*n)
}

further optimization
********************
->Use correct access modifiers
->use final keyword
->IO should be fast enough
->Avoid create many object creation
->Aviod initializing the large array many times
-> what the function should do(Naming should readable)


debuggable
**********
-> Not using too may global variables (It will confuse)
-> Use as many java library function
-> Use as many inbuild functions
ex: "".indexOf();->O(n)
